This is a collection of some of my solutions to problems posed in the course Bioinformatics Algorithms and Models (Professor David Bernick, UCSC, 2019). My algorithms are implemented in python, many of them are formatted for bioinformatics learning platform Rosalind. Detailed docstrings are included in each program.

Algorithms covered in these programs include:

- Stochastic Processes based on Shannonâ€™s Entropy for Promotor Sequence Discovery
- Eulerian Path from Directed Graph
- DeBruijn Graphing
- String (quasi-genome) Assembly
- Topological Sorting (Directed Acyclic Graphs)
- Viterbi Learning for HMM Path Maximization.
- Branch and Bound Algorithm for Cyclic Peptide Reconstruction
